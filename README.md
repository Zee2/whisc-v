# Whisc-V
The world's strangest RISC-V dialect for embedded emulators

Whisc-V is the peculiar RISC-V RTL simulator that powers the Friendly Computer project. Designed to run on resource-constrained embedded systems, Whisc-V is an RTL-level simulator that exposes registers, internal CPU state, and datapath details to the host system, allowing for rich illustration of how the system works.

Ideal for teaching the basics of system architecture, Whisc-V aims to run on the popular STM32 platform, integrating with multiple hardware I/O components for visualizing processor state.
